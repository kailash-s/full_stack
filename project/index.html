              <h3>Blackbeard Will Eat 3 Devil Fruits</h3>
              <p>Marshall D. Teach, or Blackbeard, as he's more often known, is one of the most intriguing villains in the series. He has done what no one else ever has - eaten two Devil Fruits. Through an unknown method, Blackbeard took Whitebeard's quake powers after his death. We're only told that Teach's body is special. Some think that Blackbeard has already eaten a 3rd devil fruit, based on his jolly roger having 3 skulls. A Mythical Zoan type, perhaps a cerberus, which has 3 heads, or a kraken, which has 3 hearts, would certainly fit the theme. Others believe he has yet to eat a 3rd. A Zoan-type would give him “one of each,” and he'd only want the best, right? We can think of some candidates…</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Hidden in the Left Eye</h3>
              <p>This is a complex theory, so if you want more details check out YouTubers YUDE-RON or Ohara's videos, as they came up with and popularized it. But, the gist of it is this: Laugh Tale is located on the missing left eye of the skull that once made up Jaya. Many characters in “One Piece” have marks on their left eyes or sides of their faces, hinting at this connection. And while the right eye went into the sky, what if the left eye sank to the ocean's bottom? And where's there a huge hole in the ocean? Under Enies Lobby - an island where it's always sunny. With Joy Boy having a connection to the sun god Nika. It's…certainly a journey!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Red Line Will Be Destroyed</h3>
              <p>In the “One Piece” world, there's one continent - the Red Line. This massive red walled land mass circles the world, dividing the world both physically into the Four Blue seas, but also because the tyrannical Celestial Dragons rule from atop it. It has long been theorized that Luffy will destroy the Red Line somehow, since he is prophesied to destroy Fishman Island, which lies directly beneath it. If the Red Line is destroyed, so many of the Straw Hats' dreams come true, especially Sanji, since his aim is to find the All Blue, a fabled sea made up of every Blue sea. Without the Red Line and Celestial Dragons, all people would be free. The world would be whole, it would be in - “one piece.”</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Luffy's Hidden Dream</h3>
              <p>It was long theorized, and recently confirmed, that becoming Pirate King isn't Luffy's only goal. Luffy declares his dream to his brothers in a flashback, but the audience doesn't hear it. Ace told it to Yamato, and Luffy recently tells his crew his dream in the manga, eliciting laughter. It's suggested Roger had the same dream and others reacted similarly when he told them. However, it's never been stated directly. The prevailing theory is that a young Luffy, who loved spending time with Shanks' fun-loving crew, had an equally childish dream - to throw the world's biggest party! What do the Straw Hats do after every adventure? Have a big party! And Luffy being Pirate King and freeing the world would help create a massive celebration!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The One Piece is Binks' Sake</h3>
              <p>There are many theories on what the One Piece treasure is, but this one has gained a lot of traction, thanks to YouTuber Artur. The basics are these: the term “one piece” has several meanings, including “that which unites people.” And that fits the song “Binks' Sake.” A song which may tell the story of the Ancient Kingdom through its lyrics and has the Japanese equivalent of the term “laugh tale” in them! The treasure is believed to be Binks' literal sake. Sake figures prominently throughout the story, uniting characters! And what do the Roger Pirates sing before they reach Laugh Tale? “Binks' Sake!” No wonder they laughed! Finding all that sake would certainly help with Luffy's worldwide party too!</p>
